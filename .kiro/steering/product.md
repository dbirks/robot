# Product Overview

This is a voice-controlled Reachy Mini robot project that integrates OpenAI's Realtime API with physical robot hardware. The system enables natural voice interaction with a desk robot that can perform expressive head movements and antenna gestures.

## Key Features

- **Voice Control**: Real-time voice interaction using OpenAI's Realtime API
- **Physical Robot Integration**: Controls Reachy Mini hardware via REST API
- **Simulation Support**: Full testing capability without physical hardware
- **Motion Library**: Predefined gestures (nod, shake, look_at, antenna_wiggle)
- **Dual Mode**: Supports both voice and text interaction for development

## Target Use Case

Educational and demonstration robot for natural human-robot interaction, showcasing real-time AI voice control of physical hardware with expressive movements and personality.
