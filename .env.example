# ===== OpenAI Configuration =====
# Option 1: Direct OpenAI API (RECOMMENDED)
# Get your key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here

# Option 2: Azure OpenAI - ⚠️ CURRENTLY INCOMPATIBLE ⚠️
# The openai-agents SDK v0.4.0 has a schema incompatibility with Azure OpenAI Realtime API.
# Azure doesn't include 'session.type' field that the SDK expects.
# Issue: SDK validation fails on session.created event
# Recommendation: Use OpenAI API directly until SDK adds Azure support
#
# If you need Azure, these are the variables you would use:
# AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com
# AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-realtime-mini
# AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-azure-api-key-here
# AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-10-01-preview
